    <h1>Birdy! Cards</h1>
    <h2>A website for cards</h2>
    <h3>Most of the cards have birds on them</h3>

        If you like greeting cards with birds on them (or without birds on them) <u>why not visit my Etsy shop?</u>

        (Oh, probably because it doesn't exist yet. Right.) <br>
        <i>that isn't a real link...</i>

        You can still visit Etsy though. Here: a real link. <a href="https://etsy.com">Click me!</a>
